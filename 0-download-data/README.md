# Downloading the Dataset
- Estimated time: 20 minutes

In this tutorial, we are using HuggingFace's [tiny-imagenet-200](https://huggingface.co/datasets/slegroux/tiny-imagenet-200-clean) dataset. 

To download the dataset simply use:

```bash
sbatch download_data.job
```

As before, don't forget to edit the job file with the path of your project space:

```bash
export PROJECT_SPACE=/projects/0/prjsXXXX
```
